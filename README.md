## neovim

- a minimal(ish) config written entirely in lua, taking advantage of the built-in lsp support for proper [t/jsx commenting](https://github.com/JoosepAlviste/nvim-ts-context-commentstring) and [t/jsx pair renaming](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-ts-autotag)
- if it's a default, I try not to include it in my config
- heavily inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch)

requirements:

- [ neovim ](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) >= 0.8
